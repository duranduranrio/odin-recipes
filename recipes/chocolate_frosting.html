    <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
    <p>This chocolatey frosting is a classic frosting you could use on any cake, not just the Chocolate Love Cake (though it does pair perfectly with this recipe!). This recipe makes enough frosting for one 9-inch round two-layer cake.</p>

    <br>

    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup plus 2 tbsp non-hydrogenated vegetable shortening</li>
        <li>1/4 cup plus 2 tbsp non-hydrogenated vegan margarine</li>
        <li>3 3/4 cups (1 lb, 1 oz) powdered sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (3 oz) cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 to 5 tbsp soymilk, as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the shortening and margarine and whip with the paddle attachment until completely combined. Scrape the bottom of the bowl to ensure that the ingredients are mixed thoroughly.</li>
        <li>On low speed, slowly add the powdered sugar and cocoa powder a little at a time.</li>
        <li>Once the powdered sugar and cocoa powder are incorporated, add the vanilla and soymilk and mix on low speed until the liquids are incorporated and the desired consistency is reached.</li>
        <li>Scrape the bottom of the bowl and mix on medium-high speed until all the ingredients are combined and the frosting is fluffy, about 2 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
